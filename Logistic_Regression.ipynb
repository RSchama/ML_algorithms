    "# Logistic Regression with Gradient Ascent from Scratch #\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains my implementation of the logistic regression with a gradient Ascent. I have also left the simple code `.py` file in the `code` folder, hoping that it it might be easier to imporve the code with `git`. So, I expect that at some point this notebook might be deprecated, and will be be used mostly as a tutorial.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is analogous to multiple linear regression, except the outcome is binary (0/1). There is also no closed form solution, and the model is fit using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). With MLE we are trying to find the model that most likely produced the data we see. I will talk more about the steps we need to take when we start building our algorithm.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is used for classification, which is a very important task in Machine Learning. It is part of the Supervised Learning techniques, where we use part of the known data to to learn the best model and parameters that fit our data. The known data comes as pairs of inputs ($X$) and outputs ($y$) to be able to train a model, and it is used in many applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have an input with its attribute set (variables) and we use the classification algorithm to learn how to assign class labels to these examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a form of prediction where the goal is to predict the class labels, whether if it is binary or multiclass. In this example we will use the UCI Machine Learning Repository [Gisette](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gisette) dataset. This dataset is a handwritten digit problem, where we want to separate the highly confusible digits '4' and '9', and it was constructed from the well known MNIST dataset. Since we only want to discriminate between '4' and '9', this is a binary classification problem.  \n",

Normally we would use `sklearn` `train_test_split` to split our data into train and test sets (or use cross-validation). Nevertheless, Gisette, as part of a competition dataset, already has separate sets for training the model (called `gisette_train.data` and `gisette_train.labels`) and a separate set for testing, or validating it (called `gisette_valid.data` and `gisette_valid.labels`).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Normaly it is good practice to check our data variables' distribution and scale. When we have variables with extremely different scales the ones with higher values will have more weight and might bias the analysis. So we can normalize the data to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values. We would have all variables now with ranges between 0 and 1. Or, when we have a variable with normal disribution, we can standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation in order to have all attributes to have mean 0 and 1 standard deviation. This is useful when your data has varying scales and the algorithm you are using does make assumptions about your data having a Gaussian distribution. In fact, many Machine Learning agorithms assume that all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although stardization os not required for logistic regression, it certainly helps convergence, especially because the algorithm does assume a linear distribution of variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `sklearn` [preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) to normalize the data matrices: Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It is important to remember to `fit` only to the train data in order to prevent data leakage problems. Mean and standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using `tranform`."

Here we need only call the `logit_algorithm` function with the parameters needed:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- $X$ data matrix, \n",
    "- $y$ vector of labels, \n",
    "- $\\eta$, \n",
    "- $\\lambda$ and \n",
    "- number of iterations we want.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To see how well our model works on unseen data we just need to call the `y_predict` function with the following parameters:  \n",
    "- $X$ test data matrix, \n",
    "- $y$ test label vector and \n",
    "- the $w$ vector of coeficients that we get from our algorithm function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm function also returns a list with all the log-likelihood scores from each iteration step that we can use to make a plot as we did before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting feature of jupyter is that we can always start writing the name of the function we want and use `tab` to autocomplete it (after importing the module). And we can use `shift-tab` to get the function's docstrings, if we do that for `logit_algorithm` we can see which arguments it takes and if we click on the `+` button we can see everything. It is always good to be sure what are the values the function returns and plan your variables accordingly."
