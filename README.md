Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This will hold a collection of Machine Learning algorithms I have implemented from scratch. 

Mostly in python, some in notebook format with explanantions, some only the code. I hope it is helpful for new learners as much as looking at other professionals implementations has helped me!
